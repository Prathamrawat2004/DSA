In DP problems:

If i, j represent lengths (like “first i elements” or “prefixes”),
➤ we use dp of size [n+1][m+1], because we need to include the 0-length case too.

If i, j represent actual indices in the array or string (0-based),
➤ we use dp of size [n][m], because we only need valid indices from 0...n-1
